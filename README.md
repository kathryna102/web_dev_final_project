## Overview
Welcome to our CSCI 331 Final Website! Our idea was to create a lifestyle website that includes a todo-list implementing the CRUD operations of databases. The database is where to-do list items will be stored. We have also used various API's to bring in weather, calandar, quote, and nutrition information.

## Features
a menu panel including tabs for the todo-list, weather, motivational quotes, calandar, and nutrition
  - todo list page shows all todos, user can add new ones, update them once finished using the toggle status button and delete them when they   aren't needed
  - weather page shows weather in Bozeman that day
  - calandar that shows what day it is today, when todo list items are due and holidays
      - you can click on a certain day and it will show you a list of tasks for that day
  - nutrition lookup with a search bar to search for any food. It will then pull up top three results and a nutrition label with calories,      total fat, cholesterol etc
