## Overview
Welcome to our CSCI 331 Final Website! Our idea was to create a lifestyle website that includes a todo-list implementing the CRUD operations of databases. The database is where to-do list items will be stored.  

## Features
a menu panel including tabs for the todo-list, weather, motivational quotes, calandar, and nutrition
  - todo list page shows all todos, user can add new ones, update them once finished and delete them when they aren't needed
  - weather page shows weather in Bozeman that day
